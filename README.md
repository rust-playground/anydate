# anydate &emsp; [![Latest Version]][crates.io]

[Latest Version]: https://img.shields.io/crates/v/anydate.svg
[crates.io]: https://crates.io/crates/anydate

This crate is used to parse an unknown DateTime or Date format into a normalized version.

---

```toml
[dependencies]
anydate = "0.1"
```

## Example usages
```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // see parse_utc() for convenience conversion to UTC
    let parsed = anydate::parse("2021-11-10T03:25:06.533447000Z");
    println!("{:#?}", parsed);
    Ok(())
}
```

or if you know it's only a date with no time component

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let parsed = anydate::date::parse("2021-11-10");
    println!("{:#?}", parsed);
    Ok(())
}
```
